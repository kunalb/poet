#+TITLE: poet 
[[https://melpa.org/#/poet-theme][[[https://melpa.org/packages/poet-theme-badge.svg]]]]

An emacs theme that's well suited for prose: particularly org-mode and
markdown-mode; or any mode that works well with =variable-pitch= mode.

** Motivation
The theme makes Emacs more friendly for writing prose instead of
code. Highlights include mixing monospace and variable pitch text in
markdown and org-modes, making it convenient to write prose and code
together. 

I wrote about building poet at https://explog.in/notes/poet.html.

** Set up
- *Installation*:
  - *Melpa*: Make sure [[https://melpa.org/#/getting-started][melpa is in your package archives list]], and M-x =package-install poet-theme=
  - *Manual*: Download the theme to your =custom-theme-directory= which defaults to =~/emacs.d=.

- *Variable-pitch-mode*: Adding variable pitch mode to text modes will
  help in rendering mixed fonts every time you edit markdown, org-mode,
  etc.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook
           (lambda ()
            (variable-pitch-mode 1)))
#+END_SRC

- *Custom fonts*: Choose your fonts/font sizes before loading the theme with

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "DejaVu Sans Mono" :height 130)
(set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :family "DejaVu Sans Mono")
(set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :family "IBM Plex Serif")
#+END_SRC

- *Mac OSX Title Bar*: (Only for *Emacs 26.1*+) 
#+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list
  'default-frame-alist'(ns-transparent-titlebar . t))
(add-to-list
  'default-frame-alist'(ns-appearance . light))
#+end_src
